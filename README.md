# Crime-Data-Analysis
 Crime Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
 
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Crime Data Analysis Dashboard built entirely using Power BI.
The dashboard analyzes historical crime data to identify trends, patterns, and risk areas across time, location, crime types, victim demographics, and crime outcomes, enabling data-driven insights for public safety and decision-making.
